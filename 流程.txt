# Word Embeddings 
 Glove, FastText, and Word2Vec
1,Loading the pretrained word embeddings
2,Creating a tokenizer object
3,Transforming text documents to sequence of tokens and pad them
4,Create a mapping of token and their respective embeddings

# Text / NLP based features
A number of extra text based features can also be created which sometimes are helpful for improving text classification models. Some examples are:
1,Word Count of the documents 每 total number of words in the documents
2,Character Count of the documents 每 total number of characters in the documents
3,Average Word Density of the documents 每 average length of the words used in the documents
4,Puncutation Count in the Complete Essay 每 total number of punctuation marks in the documents
5,Upper Case Count in the Complete Essay 每 total number of upper count words in the documents
6,Title Word Count in the Complete Essay 每 total number of proper case (title) words in the documents
7,Frequency distribution of Part of Speech Tags:
    Noun Count
    Verb Count
    Adjective Count
    Adverb Count
    Pronoun Count
Can also use Topic Models as features
